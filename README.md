# react-portfolio

Create portfolio using React app

## Objective

Refactor Portfolio in to a React app

## Challenges

I'm having issues in three major areas: My images are not loading, my scroll function is not fully implemented just yet, and my css has to be manipulated further. The real struggle came in breaking down my components to mimic my old portfolio to the T. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to make a few comprimises, in order to get this working effectively. Defenitely not finished, will be very soon.
